RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to protect against or limit the effects of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by employing control plane protection.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the Cisco router configuration to verify it is compliant with this requirement. 

Step 1: To verify that the CoPP policy map has been saved, issue the "show running-config" command in privileged EXEC mode and verify the following line exists in the output.

policy-map system-cpp-policy

Step 2: To view the policy map and verify the correct policer rates are set according to organization-defined standards, run the following command.

show policy-map control-plane

Note: Starting from Cisco IOS XE Fuji 16.8.1a, the creation of user-defined class-maps is not supported. One can only enable/disable a CPU queue or change the policer rate of a CPU queue.

If the Cisco router is not configured to protect against known types of DoS attacks by employing organization-defined security safeguards, this is a finding.

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.cisco.iosxe:question:281
RULE             : The Cisco perimeter router must be configured to deny network traffic by default and allow network traffic by exception.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Review the router configuration to verify that the inbound ACL applied to all external interfaces is configured to allow specific ports and protocols and deny all other traffic.

Step 1: Verify that an inbound ACL is applied to all external interfaces as shown in the example below:

interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip address x.11.1.2 255.255.255.254
 ip access-group EXTERNAL_ACL in

Step 2: Review inbound ACL to verify that it is configured to deny all other traffic that is not explicitly allowed.

ip access-list extended EXTERNAL_ACL
 permit tcp any any established
 permit tcp host x.11.1.1 eq bgp host x.11.1.2
 permit tcp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 eq bgp

 permit icmp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 echo-reply
 …
 …
 …
deny   ip any any log-input

If the ACL is not configured to allow specific ports and protocols and deny all other traffic, this is a finding. If the ACL is not configured inbound on all external interfaces, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco perimeter router must be configured to protect an enclave connected to an alternate gateway by using an inbound filter that only permits packets with destination addresses within the sites address space.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Step 1: Verify the interface connecting to ISP has an inbound ACL as shown in the example below.

interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description Link to ISP
 ip address x.22.1.15 255.255.255.240
 ip access-group FILTER_ISP in

Step 2: Verify that the ACL only allows traffic to specific destination addresses (i.e. enclave’s NIPRNet address space) as shown in the example below.

ip access-list extended FILTER_ISP
 permit tcp any any established
 permit icmp host x.12.1.16 host x.12.1.17 echo
 permit icmp host x.12.1.16 host x.12.1.17 echo-reply
 permit tcp any host x.12.1.22 eq www
 permit tcp any host x.12.1.23 eq www
 permit 50 any host x.12.1.24
 permit 51 any host x.12.1.24
 deny   ip any any log-input

Note: An Approved Gateway (AG) is any external connection from a DoD NIPRNet enclave to an Internet Service Provider, or network owned by a contractor, or non-DoD federal agency that has been approved by either the DoD CIO or the DoD Component CIO. This AG requirement does not apply to commercial cloud connections when the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) network is connected via the NIPRNet Boundary Cloud Access Point (BCAP).


If the ingress ACL bound to the interface connecting to an alternate gateway permits packets with addresses other than those specified, such as destination addresses of the site's NIPRNet address space or a destination address belonging to the address block assigned by the alternate gateway network service provider, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco perimeter router must be configured to not be a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peer to an alternate gateway service provider.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Review the router configuration and verify that it is not BGP peering with an alternate gateway service provider.

Step 1: Determine the ip address of the ISP router. 

interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description Link to ISP
 ip address x.22.1.15 255.255.255.240

Step 2: Verify that the router is not BGP peering with this router.

router bgp nn
 no synchronization
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 neighbor x.11.1.7 remote-as nn
 neighbor x.11.1.7 password xxxxxxx
 no auto-summary

In the example above, the router is not peering with the ISP.

If the router is BGP peering with an alternate gateway service provider, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the network based on organization-defined information flow control policies.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

If Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) is used to segment traffic and force traffic to traverse through next generation firewalls with ACLs, this requirement is not applicable.

Review the router configuration to verify that Access Control Lists (ACLs) are configured to allow or deny traffic for specific source and destination addresses as well as ports and protocols. For example, the configuration below will allow only printer traffic into subnet 10.1.23.0/24 and SQL traffic into subnet 10.1.24.0/24. ICMP is allowed for troubleshooting and OSPF is the routing protocol used within the network.

interface GigabitEthernet1/1

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to enable routing protocol authentication using FIPS 198-1 algorithms with keys not exceeding 180 days of lifetime.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the router configuration using the configuration examples below for BGP and OSPF.

Certain older protocols supporting only MD5 will incur a permanent finding for those protocols as MD5 is not FIPS compliant.

Note: The 180-day key lifetime is Not Applicable for the DODIN Backbone. The remainder of the requirement still applies.

Verify that neighbor router authentication is enabled for all routing protocols. If neighbor authentication is not enabled, this is a finding.

Verify that authentication is configured to use FIPS 198-1 message authentication algorithms. If the routing protocol authentication is not configured to use FIPS 198-1 algorithms this is a finding.

Verify that the protocol key lifetime is configured to not exceed 180 days. If any protocol key lifetime is configured to exceed 180 days this is a finding.

BGP Example:

key chain <KEY-CHAIN-NAME> tcp 
key <KEY-ID>
send-id <ID>
recv-id <ID>
cryptographic-algorithm hmac-sha256
key-string <KEY>
accept-lifetime 00:00:00 Jan 1 2022 duration 180

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to have Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) unreachable messages disabled on all external interfaces.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the configuration to verify the no ip unreachables command has been configured on all external interfaces as shown in the configuration example below:

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.0
 no ip unreachables

If ICMP unreachable notifications are sent from any external or null0 interface, this is a finding.

Alternative – DODIN Backbone:

Verify that the PE router is configured to rate limit ICMP unreachable messages as shown in the example below:

ip icmp rate-limit unreachable 60000
ip icmp rate-limit unreachable DF 1000

Note: In the example above, packet-too-big message (ICMP Type 3 Code 4) can be sent once every second, while all other destination unreachable messages can be sent once every minute. This will avoid disrupting Path MTU Discovery for traffic traversing the backbone while mitigating the risk of an ICMP unreachable DoS attack.

IF the PE router is not configured to rate limit ICMP unreachable messages, this is a finding.

 permit icmp host x.12.1.9 host x.12.1.10 echo-reply
 …
 …
 …
 deny   ip any any log-input

Step 2: Verify that the inbound ACL applied to all external interfaces will block all traffic from Bogon source addresses.

interface GigabitEthernet0/1

RULE             : The Cisco out-of-band management (OOBM) gateway router must be configured to transport management traffic to the Network Operations Center (NOC) via dedicated circuit, MPLS/VPN service, or IPsec tunnel.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Review the network topology diagram to determine connectivity between the managed network and the NOC. Review the OOBM gateway router configuration to validate the path and interface that the management traffic traverses. If an IPsec tunnel is used to transport the management traffic between the NOC and the managed network, review the configuration following the steps below.

Step 1: Note the crypto map applied to the external interface.

 interface interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description link to DISN
 ip address x.1.24.4 255.255.255.0
 crypto map IPSEC_MGMT_MAP

Step 2: Review the ISAKMP policy for Phase 1 negotiations and Phase 2 policy for data encryption.

crypto isakmp policy 10
 authentication pre-share
 hash sha256
 crypto isakmp key xxxxxx address x.1.12.1
!
!
crypto ipsec transform-set TRANS_SET ah-sha256-hmac esp-aes 

Step 3: Review the crypto map that was bound to the external interface and note the ACL defined that identifies the interesting traffic for the IPsec tunnel.

crypto map IPSEC_MGMT_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set peer x.1.12.1
 set transform-set TRANS_SET
 match address MGMT_TRAFFIC_ACL

Step 4: Review the ACL defined in the crypto map and verify that the destination is the management network.

ip access-list extended MGMT_TRAFFIC_ACL
 permit ip 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255

Note: The management network is this example is 10.22.2.0/24

If management traffic is not transported between the managed network and the NOC via dedicated circuit, MPLS/VPN service, or IPsec tunnel, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco out-of-band management (OOBM) gateway router must be configured to forward only authorized management traffic to the Network Operations Center (NOC).
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Review the network topology diagram to determine connectivity between the managed network and the NOC. Review the OOBM gateway router configuration to validate the path that the management traffic traverses. Verify that only management traffic is forwarded through the OOBM interface or IPsec tunnel.

If an OOBM link is used, verify that the only authorized management traffic is transported to the NOC by reviewing the outbound ACL applied to the OOBM interface as shown in the example below:

Step 1: Note the outbound ACL applied to the OOBM interface.

interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description OOB link to NOC
 ip address 10.11.1.8 255.255.255.0
 ip access-group MGMT_TRAFFIC_ACL out

Step 2: Review the outbound ACL and verify only management traffic is forwarded to the NOC.

ip access-list extended MGMT_TRAFFIC_ACL
 permit tcp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq tacacs
 permit tcp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 22
 permit udp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq snmp
 permit udp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq snmp-trap
 permit udp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq syslog
 permit icmp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.22.0 0.0.0.255 
 deny   ip any any log-input

If an IPSec tunnel is used, verify that the only authorized management traffic is transported to the NOC.

Step 1: Note the crypto map applied to the external interface.

 interface interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description link to DISN
 ip address x.1.24.4 255.255.255.0
 crypto map IPSEC_MGMT_MAP

Step 2: Review the crypto map that was bound to the external interface and note the ACL defined that identifies the interesting traffic for the IPsec tunnel.

crypto map IPSEC_MGMT_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set peer x.1.12.1
 set transform-set TRANS_SET
 match address MGMT_TRAFFIC_ACL

Step 3: Review the ACL defined in the crypto map and verify only management traffic is forwarded to the NOC.

ip access-list extended MGMT_TRAFFIC_ACL
 permit tcp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq tacacs
 permit tcp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 22
 permit udp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq snmp
 permit udp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq snmp-trap
 permit udp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq syslog
 permit icmp 10.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 10.22.22.0 0.0.0.255

Note: ICMP is permitted for troubleshooting purposes. The IPSec SA can only identify interesting traffic via address, protocol, and port; hence, the ICMP traffic cannot be qualified via type attribute.

If traffic other than authorized management traffic is permitted through the OOBM interface or IPsec tunnel, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco out-of-band management (OOBM) gateway router must be configured to block any traffic destined to itself that is not sourced from the OOBM network or the Network Operations Center (NOC).
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone. It is only applicable if the OOBM gateway router is not a dedicated device to the OOBM backbone.

Verify that traffic destined to itself is only sourced by the OOBM or the NOC. In the example below, the OOBM backbone network is 10.11.1.0/24, the NOC address spaces is 10.12.1.0/24, and the OOBM LAN address space at remote site connecting to the managed network is 10.13.1.0/24.

Step 1: Note the inbound ACL applied to the OOBM interfaces.

interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description OOB link to NOC
 ip address 10.11.1.8 255.255.255.0
 ip access-group TRAFFIC_FROM_NOC in
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 description link to OOBM LAN access switch
 ip address 10.13.1.1 255.255.255.0
 ip access-group TRAFFIC_TO_NOC in

If the ACL is not configured to only allow traffic to the route processor from the OOBM backbone and the NOC, this is a finding.

Step 2: Review the inbound ACL bound to any OOB interface connecting to the OOBM backbone and verify traffic destined to itself is only from the OOBM or NOC address space.

ip access-list extended TRAFFIC_FROM_NOC
 permit ip 10.11.1.0 0.255.255.255 host 10.11.1.8
 permit ip 10.12.1.0 0.255.255.255 host 10.11.1.8

 permit ip 10.12.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.13.1.0 0.0.0.255
 deny   ip any any log-input

Step 3: Review the inbound ACL bound to any OOBM LAN interfaces and verify traffic destined to itself is from the OOBM LAN address space.

ip access-list extended TRAFFIC_TO_NOC
 permit ip 10.13.1.0 0.255.255.255 host 10.13.1.1

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to only permit management traffic that ingresses and egresses the out-of-band management (OOBM) interface.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is only applicable where management access to the router is via an OOBM interface which is not a true OOBM interface.

Step 1: Verify that the managed interface has an inbound and outbound ACL configured. 

interface GigabitEthernet0/7
 description link to OOBM access switch
 ip address 10.11.1.22 255.255.255.0
 ip access-group INGRESS_MANAGEMENT_ACL in
 ip access-group EGRESS_MANAGEMENT_ACL out

Step 2: Verify that the ingress ACL only allows management and ICMP traffic. 

ip access-list extended INGRESS_MANAGEMENT_ACL
 permit tcp any host 10.11.1.22 eq tacacs
 permit tcp any host 10.11.1.22 eq 22
 permit udp any host 10.11.1.22 eq snmp
 permit udp any host 10.11.1.22 eq snmptrap
 permit udp any host 10.11.1.22 eq ntp
 permit icmp any host 10.11.1.22
 deny   ip any any log-input

Step 3: Verify that the egress ACL blocks any transit traffic.

ip access-list extended EGRESS_MANAGEMENT_ACL
 deny   ip any any log-input

Note: On Cisco routers, local generated packets are not inspected by outgoing interface access-lists. Hence, the above configuration would simply drop any packets not generated by the router; hence, blocking any transit traffic.

If the router does not restrict traffic that ingresses and egresses the management interface, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco BGP router must be configured to reject inbound route advertisements from a customer edge (CE) router for prefixes that are not allocated to that customer.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the router configuration to verify that there are ACLs defined to only accept routes for prefixes that belong to specific customers. 

Step 1: Verify prefix list has been configured for each customer containing prefixes belonging to each customer as shown in the example below:

ip prefix-list PREFIX_FILTER_CUST1 seq 5 permit x.13.1.0/24 le 32
ip prefix-list PREFIX_FILTER_CUST1 seq 10 deny 0.0.0.0/0 ge 8
ip prefix-list PREFIX_FILTER_CUST2 seq 5 permit x.13.2.0/24 le 32
ip prefix-list PREFIX_FILTER_CUST2 seq 10 deny 0.0.0.0/0 ge 8

Step 2: Verify that the prefix lists has been applied to all to the applicable CE peers as shown in the example below:

router bgp xx
 no synchronization
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 neighbor x.12.4.14 remote-as 64514
 neighbor x.12.4.14 prefix-list FILTER_PREFIXES_CUST1 in
 neighbor x.12.4.16 remote-as 64516
 neighbor x.12.4.16 prefix-list FILTER_PREFIXES_CUST2 in

Note: Routes to PE-CE links within a VPN are needed for troubleshooting end-to-end connectivity across the MPLS/IP backbone. Hence, these prefixes are an exception to this requirement.

Note: This check is NA for JRSS systems.

If the router is not configured to reject inbound route advertisements from each CE router for prefixes that are not allocated to that customer, this is a finding.

Review the router configuration and determine if filters are bound to the applicable interfaces to drop all inbound IPv6 packets containing an undefined option type value regardless of whether they appear in a Hop-by-Hop or Destination Option header. Undefined values are 0x02, 0x03, 0x06, 0x9 – 0xE, 0x10 – 0x22, 0x24, 0x25, 0x27 – 0x2F, and 0x31 – 0xFF.

Note: Because hop-by-hop and destination options have the same exact header format, they can be combined under the dest-option-type keyword. Since Hop-by-Hop and Destination Option headers have non-overlapping types, you can use dest-option-type to match either.

If the router is not configured to drop IPv6 packets containing a Hop-by-Hop or Destination Option extension header with an undefined option type, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco perimeter router must be configured to not redistribute static routes to an alternate gateway service provider into BGP or an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) peering with the NIPRNet or to other autonomous systems.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Step 1: Review the IGP and BGP configurations. If there are redistribute static statements configured as shown in examples below, proceed to step 2.

OSPF Example:

router ospf 1
 log-adjacency-changes
 redistribute static subnets
 network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0

EIGRP example:

router eigrp 1
 network 10.1.15.0 0.0.0.255
 redistribute static

RIP example:

router rip
 version 2
 redistribute static
 network 10.0.0.0

BGP example:

router bgp nn
 no synchronization
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 redistribute static
 neighbor x.11.1.7 remote-as nn
 neighbor x.11.1.7 password xxxxxxx
 no auto-summary

Step 2: Review the static routes that have been configured to determine if any contain the next hop address of the alternate gateway.

If the static routes to the alternate gateway are being redistributed into BGP or any IGP peering to a NIPRNet gateway or any other autonomous system, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco perimeter router must be configured to have Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) disabled on all external interfaces.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Step 1: Verify LLDP is not enabled globally via the command.  

lldp run

By default LLDP is not enabled globally. If LLDP is enabled, proceed to step 2.

Step 2: Verify LLDP is not enabled on any external interface as shown in the example below:

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip address x.1.12.1 255.255.255.252

RULE             : The Cisco BGP router must be configured to reject route advertisements from CE routers with an originating AS in the AS_PATH attribute that does not belong to that customer.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is not applicable for the DODIN Backbone.

Review the router configuration to verify the router is configured to deny updates received from CE routers with an originating AS in the AS_PATH attribute that does not belong to that customer.

Step 1: Review router configuration and verify that there is an as-path access-list statement defined to only accept routes from a CE router whose AS did not originate the route. The configuration should look similar to the following:

ip as-path access-list 10 permit ^yy$
ip as-path access-list 10 deny .*

Note: the characters “^” and “$” representing the beginning and the end of the expression respectively are optional and are implicitly defined if omitted.

Step 2: Verify that the as-path access-list is referenced by the filter-list inbound for the appropriate BGP neighbors as shown in the example below:

router bgp xx
neighbor x.1.4.12 remote-as yy
neighbor x.1.4.12 filter-list 10 in

If the router is not configured to reject updates from CE routers with an originating AS in the AS_PATH attribute that does not belong to that customer, this is a finding.

Verify that a loopback address has been configured as shown in the following example:

interface Loopback0
 ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.255

By default, routers will use its loopback address for LDP peering. If an address has not be configured on the loopback interface, it will use its physical interface connecting to the LDP peer. If the router-id command is specified that overrides this default behavior, verify that it is a loopback interface as shown in the example below:

mpls ldp router-id Loopback0

If the router is not configured to use its loopback address for LDP peering, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco PE router must be configured to enforce the split-horizon rule for all pseudowires within a Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS) bridge domain.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the PE router configuration to verify that split horizon is enabled. By default, split horizon is enabled; hence, the attribute no-split-horizon should not be seen on the neighbor command as shown in the example below:

l2 vfi VPLS_A manual 
 vpn id 110
 bridge-domain 100
 neighbor 10.3.3.3 encapsulation mpls no-split-horizon

If split horizon is not enabled, this is a finding.

Note: This requirement is only applicable to a mesh VPLS topology. VPLS solves the loop problem by using a split-horizon rule which states that member PE routers of a VPLS must forward VPLS traffic only to the local attachment circuits when they receive the traffic from the other PE routers. In a ring VPLS, split horizon must be disabled so that a PE router can forward a packet received from one pseudowire to another pseudowire. To prevent the consequential loop, at least one span in the ring would not have a pseudowire for any given VPLS instance.

class-map match-all VOICE
 match ip dscp ef
class-map match-all VIDEO
 match ip dscp af41
class-map match-all CONTROL_PLANE

class C2_VOICE
    priority percent 10
 class VOICE
    priority percent 15
 class VIDEO
    bandwidth percent 25
class CONTROL_PLANE
    priority percent 10
 class PREFERRED_DATA
    bandwidth percent 25
 class class-default

Step 3: Verify that an output service policy is bound to all interfaces as shown in the configuration example below:

interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 ip address 10.1.15.1 255.255.255.252
 service-policy output QOS_POLICY
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/2
 ip address 10.1.15.4 255.255.255.252
 service-policy output QOS_POLICY

Note: Enclaves must mark or re-mark their traffic to be consistent with the DODIN backbone admission criteria to gain the appropriate level of service. A general DiffServ principle is to mark or trust traffic as close to the source as administratively and technically possible. However, certain traffic types might need to be re-marked before handoff to the DODIN backbone to gain admission to the correct class. If such re-marking is required, it is recommended that the re-marking be performed at the CE egress edge.

If the router is not configured to enforce a QoS policy in accordance with the QoS DODIN Technical Profile, this is a finding.

 ip address 10.1.15.5 255.255.255.252
 service-policy output QOS_POLICY
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/2
 ip address 10.1.15.8 255.255.255.252
 service-policy output QOS_POLICY

If the router is not configured to implement a QoS policy in accordance with the QoS DODIN Technical Profile, this is a finding.

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.cisco.iosxe:question:1341
RULE             : The Cisco multicast Rendezvous Point (RP) router must be configured to limit the multicast forwarding cache so that its resources are not saturated by managing an overwhelming number of Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) and Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) source-active entries.
QUESTION_TEXT    : The Cisco router does not have a mechanism to limit the multicast forwarding cache. However, the risk associated with this requirement can be fully mitigated by configuring the router to:

1. Filter PIM register messages.
2. Rate limiting the number of PIM register messages.
3. Accept MSDP packets only from known MSDP peers.

Step 1:  Verify that the RP router is configured to filter PIM register messages for any undesirable multicast groups and sources. The example below will deny any multicast streams for groups 239.5.0.0/16 and allow from only sources 10.1.2.6 and 10.1.2.7. 

ip pim rp-address 10.1.12.3
ip pim accept-register list PIM_REGISTER_FILTER
…
…
…
ip access-list extended PIM_REGISTER_FILTER
 deny   ip any 239.5.0.0 0.0.255.255
 permit ip host 10.1.2.6 any
 permit ip host 10.1.2.7 any
 deny   ip any any

Step 2: Verify that the router is configured to rate limiting the number of PIM register messages as shown in the example below.

ip pim rp-address 10.2.2.2
ip pim register-rate-limit nn

Step 3: Review the router configuration to determine if there is a receive path or interface filter to only accept MSDP packets from known MSDP peers as shown in the example below.

Step 3a: Verify that interfaces used for MSDP peering have an inbound ACL as shown in the example.

interface GigabitEthernet1/1
 ip address x.1.28.8 255.255.255.0
 ip access-group EXTERNAL_ACL_INBOUND in
 ip pim sparse-mode

Step 3b: Verify that the ACL restricts MSDP peering to only known sources.

ip access-list extended EXTERNAL_ACL_INBOUND
 permit tcp any any established
 permit tcp host x.1.28.2 host x.1.28.8 eq 639
 deny   tcp any host x.1.28.8 eq 639 log
 permit tcp host x.1.28.2 host 10.1.28.8 eq bgp
 permit tcp host x.1.28.2 eq bgp host x.1.28.8
 permit pim host x.1.28.2 pim host x.1.28.8
 …
 …
 …
 deny ip any any log

Note: MSDP connections is via TCP port 639

If the RP router is not configured to filter PIM register messages, rate limiting the number of PIM register messages, and accept MSDP packets only from known MSDP peers, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco multicast Designated Router (DR) must be configured to filter the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Report messages to allow hosts to join only multicast groups that have been approved by the organization.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the configuration of the DR to verify that it is filtering IGMP or MLD Membership Report messages, allowing hosts to join only those groups that have been approved.

Step 1: Verify that all host facing interfaces are configured to filter IGMP Membership Report messages (IGMP joins) as shown in the example below:

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.3.3.3 255.255.255.0
 ip pim sparse-mode
 ip igmp access-group IGMP_JOIN_FILTER
 ip igmp version 3

Step 2: Verify that the ACL denies unauthorized groups or permits only authorized groups. The example below denies all groups from 239.8.0.0/16 range.

ip access-list standard IGMP_JOIN_FILTER
 deny   239.8.0.0 0.0.255.255
 permit any

Note: This requirement is only applicable to Source Specific Multicast (SSM) implementation. This requirement is not applicable to Any Source Multicast (ASM) since the filtering is being performed by the Rendezvous Point router.

If the DR is not filtering IGMP or MLD Membership Report messages, this is a finding.
