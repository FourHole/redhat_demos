RULE             : RHEL 9 local disk partitions must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information that requires at rest protection.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest encryption at the operating system level, such as encryption provided by a hypervisor or a disk storage array in a virtualized environment, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify RHEL 9 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information requiring at-rest protection by using disk encryption. 

Note: If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest encryption, this requirement is Not Applicable.

List all block devices in tree-like format:

$ sudo lsblk --tree

    |-rhel-varlogaudit     253:6    0    4G       0     lvm     /var/log/audit

Verify that the block device tree for each persistent filesystem, excluding the /boot and /boot/efi filesystems, has at least one parent block device of type "crypt", and that the encryption type is LUKS:

$ sudo cryptsetup status luks-b74f6910-2547-4399-86b2-8b0252d926d7
/dev/mapper/luks-b74f6910-2547-4399-86b2-8b0252d926d7 is active and is in use.
  type:    LUKS2
  cipher:  aes-xts-plain64
  keysize: 512 bits
  key location: keyring
  device:  /dev/nvme0n1p3
  sector size:  512
  offset:  32768 sectors
  size:    995986063 sectors
  mode:    read/write

If there are persistent filesystems (other than /boot or /boot/efi) whose block device trees do not have a crypt block device of type LUKS, ask the administrator to indicate how persistent filesystems are encrypted. 

If there is no evidence that persistent filesystems are encrypted, this is a finding.

RULE             : RHEL 9 vendor packaged system security patches and updates must be installed and up to date.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify RHEL 9 security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by organizational policy.

Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for updates is https://access.redhat.com/errata-search/. It is important to note that updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed.

Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:

$ dnf history list | more

    ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
   70 | install aide | 2023-03-05 10:58 | Install | 1    
   69 | update -y | 2023-03-04 14:34 | Update | 18 EE    
   68 | install vlc | 2023-02-21 17:12 | Install | 21   
   67 | update -y | 2023-02-21 17:04 | Update | 7 EE 

Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM.

If the system is in noncompliance with the organizational patching policy, this is a finding.

RULE             : RHEL 9 must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting local or remote access to the system via a command line user logon.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify RHEL 9 displays the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the operating system via a command line user logon.

Check that a banner is displayed at the command line login screen with the following command:

$ sudo cat /etc/issue

If the banner is set correctly it will return the following text:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

If the banner text does not match the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner exactly, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

RULE             : RHEL 9 must ensure cryptographic verification of vendor software packages.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Confirm Red Hat package-signing keys are installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

Note: For RHEL 9 software packages, Red Hat uses GPG keys labeled "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 3". The keys are defined in key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" by default.

List Red Hat GPG keys installed on the system:

$ sudo rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey | grep -i "red hat"

Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) <security@redhat.com> public key
Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) <security@redhat.com> public key

If Red Hat GPG keys "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 3" are not installed, this is a finding.

List key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys:

$ sudo gpg -q --keyid-format short --with-fingerprint /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

If key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" is missing, this is a finding.

Example output:

pub   rsa4096/FD431D51 2009-10-22 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 567E 347A D004 4ADE 55BA  8A5F 199E 2F91 FD43 1D51
uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) <security@redhat.com>
pub   rsa4096/5A6340B3 2022-03-09 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 7E46 2425 8C40 6535 D56D  6F13 5054 E4A4 5A63 40B3
uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) <security@redhat.com>

Compare key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys with fingerprints listed for RHEL 9 on Red Hat "Product Signing Keys" webpage at https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key.

If key fingerprints do not match, this is a finding.

RULE             : RHEL 9 must be configured so that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification.

List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following commands:

Note: Device files are normally found under "/dev", but applications may place device files in other directories and may necessitate a search of the entire system.

# find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

# find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

Note: There are device files, such as "/dev/vmci", that are used when the operating system is a host virtual machine. They will not be owned by a user on the system and require the "device_t" label to operate. These device files are not a finding.

If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted, this is a finding.

RULE             : RHEL 9 must not have unauthorized accounts.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify that there are no unauthorized interactive user accounts with the following command:

$ less /etc/passwd  

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...
games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
scsaustin:x:1001:1001:scsaustin:/home/scsaustin:/bin/bash
djohnson:x:1002:1002:djohnson:/home/djohnson:/bin/bash

Interactive user accounts generally will have a user identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater, a home directory in a specific partition, and an interactive shell.

Obtain the list of interactive user accounts authorized to be on the system from the system administrator or information system security officer (ISSO) and compare it to the list of local interactive user accounts on the system.

If there are unauthorized local user accounts on the system, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify that RHEL 9 routinely executes a file integrity scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.

Check the cron directories for scripts controlling the execution and notification of results of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following commands:

$ sudo ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Nov 22 2015 aide

$ sudo grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root

$ sudo more /etc/cron.daily/aide

#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil

If the file integrity application does not exist, a script file controlling the execution of the file integrity application does not exist, or the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.

FIPS
 
If the systemwide crypto policy is not set to "FIPS", this is a finding.

Inspect the contents of the REQUIRE.pmod file (if it exists) to ensure that only authorized modifications to the current policy are included with the following command:

$ cat /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/REQUIRE.pmod

Note: If subpolicies have been configured, they could be listed in a colon-separated list starting with FIPS as follows FIPS:<SUBPOLICY-NAME>:<SUBPOLICY-NAME>. This is not a finding.

If the AD-SUPPORT subpolicy module is included (e.g., "FIPS:AD-SUPPORT"), and Active Directory support is not documented as an operational requirement with the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

If the NO-ENFORCE-EMS subpolicy module is included (e.g., "FIPS:NO-ENFORCE-EMS"), and not enforcing EMS is not documented as an operational requirement with the ISSO, this is a finding.

Verify the current minimum crypto-policy configuration with the following commands:
 
$ grep -E 'rsa_size|hash' /etc/crypto-policies/state/CURRENT.pol
hash = SHA2-256 SHA2-384 SHA2-512 SHA2-224 SHA3-256 SHA3-384 SHA3-512 SHAKE-256
min_rsa_size = 2048
 
If the "hash" values do not include at least the following FIPS 140-3 compliant algorithms  "SHA2-256 SHA2-384 SHA2-512 SHA2-224 SHA3-256 SHA3-384 SHA3-512 SHAKE-256", this is a finding.

If there are algorithms that include "SHA1" or a hash value less than "256" this is a finding.

If the "min_rsa_size" is not set to a value of at least 2048, this is a finding.
 
If these commands do not return any output, this is a finding.

RULE             : The RHEL 9 SSH client must be configured to use only DOD-approved encryption ciphers employing FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic hash algorithms to protect the confidentiality of SSH client connections.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the SSH client is configured to use only ciphers employing FIPS 140-3 approved algorithms.

To verify the ciphers in the systemwide SSH configuration file, use the following command:

$ grep -i Ciphers /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config 

Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-ctr

If the cipher entries in the "openssh.config" file have any ciphers other than "aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-ctr", or they are missing or commented out, this is a finding.

RULE             : The RHEL 9 fapolicy module must be configured to employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the RHEL 9 "fapolicyd" employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy.

Check that "fapolicyd" is in enforcement mode with the following command:

$ sudo grep permissive /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf

permissive = 0

Check that "fapolicyd" employs a deny-all policy on system mounts with the following commands:

$ sudo tail /etc/fapolicyd/compiled.rules

allow exe=/usr/bin/python3.7 : ftype=text/x-python
deny_audit perm=any pattern=ld_so : all
deny perm=any all : all

If "fapolicyd" is not running in enforcement mode with a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy, this is a finding.
