/dev/sda3 53479424 125829119 72349696 34.5G 83 Linux

Verify the system partitions are all encrypted with the following command: 

> sudo more /etc/crypttab

cr_root  UUID=26d4a101-7f48-4394-b730-56dc00e65f64
cr_home  UUID=f5b8a790-14cb-4b82-882d-707d52f27765

RULE             : The SUSE operating system must display the approved Standard Mandatory DoD Notice before granting local or remote access to the system via a graphical user logon.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: If the system does not have a graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify the SUSE operating system displays the approved Standard Mandatory DoD Notice before granting local or remote access to the system via a graphical user logon.

Check that the SUSE operating system displays the exact approved Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner text by performing the following command:

> grep banner-message-text /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/*
banner-message-text=
"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.\nBy using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:\n-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.\n-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.\n-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.\n-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.\n-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.

Note: The "\n" characters are for formatting only. They will not be displayed on the GUI.

If the banner text does not exactly match the approved Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

RULE             : Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) must verify the baseline SUSE operating system configuration at least weekly.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the SUSE operating system checks the baseline configuration for unauthorized changes at least once weekly.

Note: A file integrity tool other than AIDE may be used, but the tool must be executed at least once per week.

Check for the presence of a cron job running daily or weekly on the system that executes AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in the following example looks at the daily cron job:

Check the "/etc/cron" subdirectories for a "crontab" file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:

     > sudo grep -R aide /etc/crontab /etc/cron.*
     /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * /etc/aide

If the file integrity application does not exist, or a "crontab" file does not exist in "/etc/crontab", the "/etc/cron.daily" subdirectory, or "/etc/cron.weekly" subdirectory, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the SUSE operating system allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.

Determine to which partition the audit records are being written with the following command:

> sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the example being /var/log/audit/) with the following command:

> df -h /var/log/audit/
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var

If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records (/var/log/audit is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command:

> sudo du -sh [audit_partition]
1.8G /var/log/audit

The partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. In normal circumstances, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records will be sufficient.

If the audit record partition is not allocated sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding.

/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var

If the audit records are not being written to a partition specifically created for audit records (in this example "/var/log/audit" is a separate partition), use the following command to determine the amount of space other files in the partition currently occupy:

> sudo du -sh <partition>
1.8G /var/log/audit

Determine the threshold for the system to take action when 75 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached:

> sudo grep -iw space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left = 225 

If the value of the "space_left" keyword is not set to 25 percent of the total partition size, this is a finding.

RULE             : All SUSE operating system local interactive users must have a home directory assigned in the /etc/passwd file.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify SUSE operating system local interactive users on the system have a home directory assigned.

Check for missing local interactive user home directories with the following command:

> sudo pwck -r
user 'smithj': directory '/home/smithj' does not exist

Ask the System Administrator (SA) if any users found without home directories are local interactive users. If the SA is unable to provide a response, check for users with a User Identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater with the following command:

> awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($1!="nobody"){print $1 ":" $3}' /etc/passwd

If any interactive users do not have a home directory assigned, this is a finding.

RULE             : A separate file system must be used for SUSE operating system user home directories (such as /home or an equivalent).
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for SUSE operating system non-privileged local interactive user home directories.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users (those with a UID greater than 1000) on the system with the following command:

> awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1, $3, $6, $7}' /etc/passwd

adamsj 1002 /home/adamsj /bin/bash
jacksonm 1003 /home/jacksonm /bin/bash
smithj 1001 /home/smithj /bin/bash

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, /home) and user's shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of /home is used in the example.

> grep /home /etc/fstab
UUID=333ada18 /home ext4 noatime,nobarrier,nodev 1 2

If a separate entry for the file system/partition that contains the non-privileged interactive users' home directories does not exist, this is a finding.
