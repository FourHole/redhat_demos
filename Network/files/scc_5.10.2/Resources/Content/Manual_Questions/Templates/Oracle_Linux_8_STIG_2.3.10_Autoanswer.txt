RULE             : All OL 8 local disk partitions must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information that requires at-rest protection.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify OL 8 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information requiring at-rest protection by using disk encryption. 
 
If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest encryption at the operating system level, such as encryption provided by a hypervisor or a disk storage array in a virtualized environment, this requirement is not applicable.
  
Verify all system partitions are encrypted with the following command: 
 
     $ sudo blkid

     /dev/mapper/ol-root:  UUID="67b7d7fe-de60-6fd0-befb-e6748cf97743" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
 
Every persistent disk partition present must be of type "crypto_LUKS".
 
If any partitions other than the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as "/proc" or "/sys") are not listed, ask the administrator to indicate how the partitions are encrypted. If there is no evidence that these partitions are encrypted, this is a finding.

RULE             : OL 8 vendor-packaged system security patches and updates must be installed and up to date.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by the site or Program Management Office (PMO). 
 
Obtain the list of available package security updates from Oracle. The URL for updates is https://linux.oracle.com/errata/. It is important to note that updates provided by Oracle may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed. 
 
Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command: 
 
$ sudo yum history list | more 
 
Loaded plugins: langpacks, product-id, subscription-manager 
ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
70 | install aide | 2020-03-05 10:58 | Install | 1 
69 | update -y | 2020-03-04 14:34 | Update | 18 EE 
68 | install vlc | 2020-02-21 17:12 | Install | 21 
67 | update -y | 2020-02-21 17:04 | Update | 7 EE 
 
If package updates have not been performed on the system within the timeframe that the site/program documentation requires, this is a finding. 
 
Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM. 
 
If the operating system is not in compliance with the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process, this is a finding.

RULE             : OL 8 must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting local or remote access to the system via an SSH logon.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify that any publicly accessible connection to the operating system displays the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system.

Check for the location of the banner file being used with the following command:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*banner'

banner /etc/issue

This command will return the banner keyword and the name of the file that contains the SSH banner (in this case "/etc/issue").

If the line is commented out, this is a finding.

If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

View the file specified by the banner keyword to check that it matches the text of the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

If the system does not display a graphical logon banner or the banner does not match the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

If the text in the file does not match the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

RULE             : The OL 8 file integrity tool must notify the System Administrator (SA) when changes to the baseline configuration or anomalies in the operation of any security functions are discovered within an organizationally defined frequency.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system routinely checks the baseline configuration for unauthorized changes and notifies the SA when anomalies in the operation of any security functions are discovered.

Check that OL 8 routinely executes a file integrity scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.

Check the cron directories for scripts controlling the execution and notification of results of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following commands:

     $ sudo ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide

     -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Nov 22 2015 aide

     $ sudo grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root

     /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * /root/aide
     /var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /root/aide

     $ sudo more /etc/cron.daily/aide

     #!/bin/bash 
     /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily AIDE integrity check run" root@example_server_name.mil

If the file integrity application does not exist, a script file controlling the execution of the file integrity application does not exist, or the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: For OL 8 systems using the Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) Release 6 or above and with secureboot enabled, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify the operating system is configured to disable kernel image loading with the following commands.

Check the status of the "kernel.kexec_load_disabled" kernel parameter:

$ sudo sysctl kernel.kexec_load_disabled

kernel.kexec_load_disabled = 1

If "kernel.kexec_load_disabled" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding.

Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter:

$ sudo grep -r kernel.kexec_load_disabled /run/sysctl.d/*.conf /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf

/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf:kernel.kexec_load_disabled = 1

If "kernel.kexec_load_disabled" is not set to "1" or is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system implements certificate status checking for multifactor authentication.

Note: If the system administrator (SA) demonstrates the use of an approved alternate multifactor authentication method, this requirement is not applicable.

Determine if Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is enabled and using the proper digest value on the system with the following command:

$ sudo grep certificate_verification /etc/sssd/sssd.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/*.conf | grep -v "^#"

certificate_verification = ocsp_dgst=sha1

If the certificate_verification line is missing from the [sssd] section, or is missing "ocsp_dgst=sha1", ask the administrator to indicate what type of multifactor authentication is being used and how the system implements certificate status checking. If there is no evidence of certificate status checking being used, this is a finding.

RULE             : OL 8 must be configured so that all files and directories contained in local interactive user home directories are group-owned by a group of which the home directory owner is a member.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify all files and directories in a local interactive user home directory are group-owned by a group that the user is a member.

Check the group owner of all files and directories in a local interactive user's home directory with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user "smithj", who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

$ sudo ls -lLR /<home directory>/<users home directory>/
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj 193 Mar  5 17:06 file2
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj sa        231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files found with a group-owner different from the home directory user private group, determine if the user is a member of that group with the following command:

$ sudo grep smithj /etc/group
sa:x:100:juan,shelley,bob,smithj 
smithj:x:521:smithj

If any files or directories are group owned by a group that the directory owner is not a member of, this is a finding.

RULE             : OL 8 must prevent a user from overriding the session idle-delay setting for the graphical user interface.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: This requirement assumes the use of the OL 8 default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable. 

Verify the operating system prevents a user from overriding settings for graphical user interfaces. 
 
Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user 
 
system-db:local 
 
Check that graphical settings are locked from non-privileged user modification with the following command. 
 
Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used. 
 
$ sudo grep -i idle /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/* 
 
/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/idle-delay 
 
If the command does not return at least the example result, this is a finding.

RULE             : OL 8 must allocate audit record storage capacity to store at least one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify OL 8 allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility. 
 
Determine to which partition the audit records are being written with the following command: 
 
$ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf 
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log 
 
Check the size of the partition to which audit records are written (with the example being "/var/log/audit/") with the following command: 
 
$ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/ 
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit 
 
If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records ("/var/log/audit" is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command: 
 
$ sudo du -sh [audit_partition] 
1.8G /var/log/audit 
 
If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding. 
 
Note: The partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. Typically 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records should be sufficient.

RULE             : OL 8 must cover or disable the built-in or attached camera when not in use.
QUESTION_TEXT    : If the device or operating system does not have a camera installed, this requirement is not applicable.

This requirement is not applicable to mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), where the use of the camera is a local AO decision.

This requirement is not applicable to dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally managed.

For an external camera, if there is not a method for the operator to manually disconnect the camera at the end of collaborative computing sessions, this is a finding.

For a built-in camera, the camera must be protected by a camera cover (e.g., laptop camera cover slide) when not in use.

If the built-in camera is not protected with a camera cover or is not physically disabled, this is a finding.

If the camera is not disconnected, covered, or physically disabled, determine if it is being disabled via software with the following commands:

Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the uvcvideo kernel module.

     $ sudo grep -r uvcvideo /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "/bin/false"
     install uvcvideo /bin/false

If the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out, and the collaborative computing device has not been authorized for use, this is a finding.

Verify the camera is disabled via blacklist with the following command:

     $ sudo grep -r uvcvideo /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "blacklist"
     blacklist uvcvideo

If the command does not return any output or the output is not "blacklist uvcvideo", and the collaborative computing device has not been authorized for use, this is a finding.

RULE             : The OL 8 file integrity tool must be configured to verify extended attributes.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify extended attributes. 
 
If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system. 
 
Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. This requirement assumes the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory. 
 
Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location: 
 
$ sudo find / -name aide.conf 
 
Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "xattrs" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists. 
 
An example rule that includes the "xattrs" rule follows: 
 
All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux 
/bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
/sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 
 
If the "xattrs" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or extended attributes are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify ACLs. 

Use the following command to determine if the file is in a location other than "/etc/aide/aide.conf": 
 
     $ sudo find / -name aide.conf 
 
Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "acl" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists with the following command: 
 
     $ sudo grep -E "[+]?acl" /etc/aide.conf 
 
     VarFile = OwnerMode+n+l+X+acl 
 
If the "acl" rule is not being used on all selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file or is commented out, or ACLs are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.
