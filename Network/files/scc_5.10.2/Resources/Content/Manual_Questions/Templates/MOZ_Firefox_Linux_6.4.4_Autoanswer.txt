QUESTION         : 3 of 5
TITLE            : CAT II, V-251560, SV-251560r918133, SRG-APP-000175
TEST_ACTION_ID   : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.firefox.linux:testaction:281
QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.firefox.linux:question:281
RULE             : Firefox must have the DOD root certificates installed.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Type "about:preferences#privacy" in the browser window. 

Scroll down to the bottom and select "View Certificates...".

In the Certificate Manager window, select the "Authorities" tab.

Scroll through the Certificate Name list to the U.S. Government heading. Look for the entries for DOD Root CA 2, DOD Root CA 3, DOD Root CA 4, and DOD Root CA 5.

If there are entries for DOD Root CA 2, DOD Root CA 3, DOD Root CA 4, and DOD Root CA 5, select them individually.

Click the "View" button.

Verify the publishing organization is "US Government".

If there are no entries for the appropriate DOD root certificates, this is a finding. If other AO-approved certificates are used, this is not a finding. If SIPRNet-specific certificates are used, this is not a finding.

Note: In a Windows environment, use of policy setting "security.enterprise_roots.enabled=true" will point Firefox to the Windows Trusted Root Certification Authority Store. This is not a finding. It may also be set via the policy Certificates >> ImportEnterpriseRoots, which can be verified via "about:policies".
