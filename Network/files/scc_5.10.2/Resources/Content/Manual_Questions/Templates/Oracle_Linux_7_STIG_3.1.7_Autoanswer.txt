RULE             : The Oracle Linux operating system must be configured so that the file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands match the vendor values.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands match the vendor values.

Check the default file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands with the following command:

     # for i in `rpm -Va | grep -E '^.{1}M|^.{5}U|^.{6}G' | cut -d " " -f 4,5`;do for j in `rpm -qf $i`;do rpm -ql $j --dump | cut -d " " -f 1,5,6,7 | grep $i;done;done

     /var/log/gdm 040755 root root
     /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf 0100640 root root
     /usr/bin/passwd 0104755 root root

For each file returned, verify the current permissions, ownership, and group membership:
     # ls -la <filename>

     -rw-------. 1 root root  2017 Nov 1 10:03 /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf

If the file is more permissive than the default permissions, this is a finding.

If the file is not owned by the default owner and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

If the file is not a member of the default group and is not documented with the ISSO, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Oracle Linux operating system must display the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner before granting local or remote access to the system via a command line user logon.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system displays the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the operating system via a command line user logon.

Check to see if the operating system displays a banner at the command line logon screen with the following command:

# more /etc/issue

The command should return the following text:
"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

If the operating system does not display a graphical logon banner or the banner does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

If the text in the "/etc/issue" file does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

All administrators must be mapped to the "staff_u", or an appropriately tailored confined SELinux user as defined by the organization.

All authorized nonadministrative users must be mapped to the "user_u" SELinux user.

If they are not mapped in this way, this is a finding.
If administrator accounts are mapped to the "sysadm_u" SELinux user and are not documented as an operational requirement with the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
If administrator accounts are mapped to the "sysadm_u" SELinux user and are documented as an operational requirement with the ISSO, this can be downgraded to a CAT III.

RULE             : The Oracle Linux operating system must be configured so that designated personnel are notified if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system notifies designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.

Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed and notify specified individuals via email or an alert.

Check for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that executes AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The commands used in the example will use a daily occurrence.

Check the cron directories for a "crontab" script file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:
    
     # ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 602 Mar 6 20:02 aide

     # grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root
     /etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide  --check
     /var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /usr/sbin/aide  --check

AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the cron job uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity run as in the following example:

     # more /etc/cron.daily/aide
     #!/bin/bash

     /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily AIDE integrity check run" root@example_server_name.mil

If the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Oracle Linux operating system security patches and updates must be installed and up to date.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by the site or Program Management Office (PMO). 

Obtain the list of available package security updates from Oracle. The URL for updates is https://linux.oracle.com/errata/. It is important to note that updates provided by Oracle may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed.

Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:

# yum history list | more
Loaded plugins: langpacks, product-id, subscription-manager
ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70 | install aide | 2016-05-05 10:58 | Install | 1

67 | update -y | 2016-04-21 17:04 | Update | 7 EE
66 | update -y | 2016-04-15 16:47 | E, I, U | 84 EE

If package updates have not been performed on the system within the timeframe required by the site/program documentation, this is a finding. 

Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM.

If the operating system is in non-compliance with the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process, this is a finding.

gopher:x:13:30:gopher:/var/gopher:/sbin/nologin

Accounts such as "games" and "gopher" are not authorized accounts as they do not support authorized system functions. 

If the accounts on the system do not match the provided documentation, or accounts that do not support an authorized system function are present, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification.

List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following commands:

Note: Device files are normally found under "/dev", but applications may place device files in other directories and may necessitate a search of the entire system.

#find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

#find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

Note: There are device files, such as "/dev/vmci", that are used when the operating system is a host virtual machine. They will not be owned by a user on the system and require the "device_t" label to operate. These device files are not a finding.

If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the file integrity tool is configured to use FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic hashes for validating file contents and directories.

Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory. 

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

     # find / -name aide.conf

Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "sha512" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists. Exclude any log files, or files expected to change frequently, to reduce unnecessary notifications.

An example rule that includes the "sha512" rule follows:
 
     All=p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
     /bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
     /sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 

If the "sha512" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or another file integrity tool is not using FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic hashes for validating file contents and directories, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the system is not configured to use a boot loader on removable media.

Note: GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the "/boot/grub2/grub.cfg" file on traditional BIOS-based machines and from the "/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg" file on UEFI machines.

Check for the existence of alternate boot loader configuration files with the following command:

     # find / -name grub.cfg
     /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

If a "grub.cfg" is found in any subdirectories other than "/boot/grub2/" and "/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/", ask the system administrator (SA) if there is documentation signed by the information system security officer (ISSO) to approve the use of removable media as a boot loader. 

List the number of menu entries defined in the grub configuration file with the following command (the number will vary between systems):

     # grep -cw menuentry /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
     4

Check that the grub configuration file has the "set root" command for each menu entry with the following command ("set root" defines the disk and partition or directory where the kernel and GRUB 2 modules are stored):

     # grep 'set root' /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
     set root='hd0,gpt2'
     set root='hd0,gpt2'
     set root='hd0,gpt2'

QUESTION_TEXT    : Inspect the firewall configuration and running services to verify that it is configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services that are unnecessary or prohibited.

Check which services are currently active with the following command:

# firewall-cmd --list-all
public (default, active)
interfaces: enp0s3
sources: 
services: dhcpv6-client dns http https ldaps rpc-bind ssh
ports:

RULE             : The Oracle Linux operating system must display the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner immediately prior to, or as part of, remote access logon prompts.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify any publicly accessible connection to the operating system displays the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system.

Check for the location of the banner file being used with the following command:

# grep -i banner /etc/ssh/sshd_config

banner /etc/issue

This command will return the banner keyword and the name of the file that contains the ssh banner (in this case "/etc/issue").

If the line is commented out, this is a finding.

View the file specified by the banner keyword to check that it matches the text of the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

If the system does not display a graphical logon banner or the banner does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

If the text in the file does not match the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Oracle Linux operating system must implement cryptography to protect the integrity of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication communications.
QUESTION_TEXT    : If LDAP is not being utilized, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify the operating system implements cryptography to protect the integrity of remote LDAP authentication sessions.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

     # systemctl status sssd.service
     sssd.service - System Security Services Daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sssd.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-06-27 10:58:11 EST; 1h 50min ago

If the "sssd.service" is "active", then LDAP is being used.

Determine the "id_provider" the LDAP is currently using:

     # grep -ir id_provider /etc/sssd/sssd.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/*.conf
     id_provider = ad

If "id_provider" is set to "ad", this is Not Applicable.

Ensure LDAP is configured to use TLS, by using the following command:

     # grep -ir start_tls /etc/sssd/sssd.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/*.conf
     ldap_id_use_start_tls = true

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the system is configured to prevent unrestricted mail relaying.

Determine if "postfix" is installed with the following commands:

# yum list installed postfix
postfix-2.6.6-6.el7.x86_64.rpm 

If postfix is not installed, this is Not Applicable.

If postfix is installed, determine if it is configured to reject connections from unknown or untrusted networks with the following command:

# postconf -n smtpd_client_restrictions
smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject

If the "smtpd_client_restrictions" parameter contains any entries other than "permit_mynetworks" and "reject", this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify "AUTH_GSS" is being used to authenticate NFS mounts.

To check if the system is importing an NFS file system, look for any entries in the "/etc/fstab" file that have a file system type of "nfs" with the following command:

# cat /etc/fstab | grep nfs
192.168.21.5:/mnt/export /data1 nfs4 rw,sync ,soft,sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p

RULE             : The Oracle Linux operating system access control program must be configured to grant or deny system access to specific hosts and services.
QUESTION_TEXT    : If the "firewalld" package is not installed, ask the System Administrator (SA) if another firewall application (such as iptables) is installed. If an application firewall is not installed, this is a finding. 

Verify the system's access control program is configured to grant or deny system access to specific hosts.

Check to see if "firewalld" is active with the following command:

# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
Active: active (running) since Sun 2014-04-20 14:06:46 BST; 30s ago

If "firewalld" is active, check to see if it is configured to grant or deny access to specific hosts or services with the following commands:

# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
public

# firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public
public (active)
target: default
icmp-block-inversion: no
interfaces: eth0
sources:
services: mdns ssh
ports:
protocols:
masquerade: no
forward-ports:
icmp-blocks:

If "firewalld" is not active, determine whether "tcpwrappers" is being used by checking whether the "hosts.allow" and "hosts.deny" files are empty with the following commands:

# ls -al /etc/hosts.allow
rw-r----- 1 root root 9 Aug 2 23:13 /etc/hosts.allow

# ls -al /etc/hosts.deny
-rw-r----- 1 root root 9 Apr 9 2007 /etc/hosts.deny

If "firewalld" and "tcpwrappers" are not installed, configured, and active, ask the SA if another access control program (such as iptables) is installed and active. Ask the SA to show that the running configuration grants or denies access to specific hosts or services.

If "firewalld" is active and is not configured to grant access to specific hosts or "tcpwrappers" is not configured to grant or deny access to specific hosts, this is a finding.

# systemctl status ipsec
ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
Active: inactive (dead)

If the "IPsec" service is active, check to see if any tunnels are configured in "/etc/ipsec.conf" and "/etc/ipsec.d/" with the following commands:

# grep -iw conn /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf

If there are indications that a "conn" parameter is configured for a tunnel, ask the System Administrator if the tunnel is documented with the ISSO. 

If "libreswan" is installed, "IPsec" is active, and an undocumented tunnel is active, this is a finding.
