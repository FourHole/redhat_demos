RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to authenticate SNMP messages using a FIPS-validated Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC).
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the Cisco router configuration to verify that it is compliant with this requirement as shown in the example below.

snmp-server group V3GROUP v3 auth read V3READ write V3WRITE 
snmp-server view V3READ iso included
snmp-server view V3WRITE iso included
snmp-server host x.x.x.x version 3 auth V3USER

Authentication used by the SNMP users can be viewed via the show snmp user command as shown in the example below.

R4#show snmp user

User name: V3USER
Engine ID: 800000090300C2042B540000
storage-type: nonvolatile active
Authentication Protocol: SHA
Privacy Protocol: None
Group-name: V3GROUP

If the Cisco router is not configured to authenticate SNMP messages using a FIPS-validated HMAC, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to authenticate Network Time Protocol (NTP) sources using authentication that is cryptographically based.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the Cisco router configuration to verify that it is compliant with this requirement as shown in the configuration example below.

ntp authentication-key 1 hmac-sha2-256 xxxxxx
ntp authenticate
ntp trusted-key 1
ntp server x.x.x.x key 1
ntp server y.y.y.y key 1

If the Cisco router is not configured to authenticate NTP sources using authentication that is cryptographically based, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to back up the configuration when changes occur.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the Cisco router configuration to verify that it is compliant with this requirement. The example configuration below will send the configuration to a TFTP server when a configuration change occurs.

event manager applet BACKUP_CONFIG
 event syslog pattern "%SYS-5-CONFIG_I"
 action 1 info type routername
 action 2 cli command "enable"
 action 3 cli command "copy run tftp" pattern "remote host"
 action 4 cli command "x.x.x.x" pattern "filename"
 action 5 cli command "$_info_routername-config"
 action 6 syslog priority informational msg "Configuration backup was executed"

If the Cisco router is not configured to conduct backups of the configuration when changes occur, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to obtain its public key certificates from an appropriate certificate policy through an approved service provider.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the router configuration to determine if a CA trust point has been configured. The CA trust point will contain the URL of the CA in which the router has enrolled with. Verify this is a DOD or DOD-approved CA. This will ensure the router has enrolled and received a certificate from a trusted CA. The CA trust point configuration would look similar to the example below.

crypto pki trustpoint CA_X
 enrollment url http://trustpoint1.example.com

Note: A remote end-point's certificate will always be validated by the router by verifying the signature of the CA on the certificate using the CA's public key, which is contained in the router's certificate it received at enrollment.

Note: This requirement is not applicable if the router does not have any public key certificates.

If the Cisco router is not configured to obtain its public key certificates from an appropriate certificate policy through an approved service provider, this is a finding.
